  <p>Bubble sort it's one of the easiest to learn at the beginning, so we're going to focus on this one.
     The main idea of a bubble sort algorithm is to sort an array using bubbles of elements. How it does that? 
     It's underlying mechanism can be summarized as follows:<br>

     While the array is not sorted, the code would do the following steps:<br>
    
     1. Take each pair of 2 adjacent numbers and compare them.<br>
     2. If their order is not correct, switch them.<br>

     The very important step is to keep in mind that these steps are repeated over and over until the array gets to its final sorted state.</p>
